## How to use                            
#### Encode                            
Write `python3 main.py` in script directory.                            
Your image will be saved in script directory as image.png                            
Name of file can be changed in the end of the script                            
#### Decode
Put your image to the script directory and change name to image.png (or change name in script)                            
Write `python3 decode.py` in script directory.
